##How does it do it?##
When either one of the main section headers or the headers within the 'expanded' sections are clicked, a new <div> (or possibly <section>) is created. Within the 'main' expanded sections are new <h4> objects.

In order to make these changes, we will need to use the following CSS styles:

color
-webkit-transform:rotate(xdeg)
display: none
